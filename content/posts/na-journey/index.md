# Intro

Many of us are hesitant in starting· Many of us loose time between deciding if it's worth it or which path to take. I agree, it is difficult and the older your are the bigger the barriers you set to yourself, but as soon as you realize that this is the only way forward, you are already late! So, start small and don't stall anymore. Do what others are advising and (b|v)logging about - start with a minimum lovable project and take it further.

My greatest fears were that I didn't feel that I had enough time in my over 20 years career to transition to an experienced and competent network automation engineer, and that my current line of business was not bringing me closer to my aspirations. So, I was fighting internally loosing time over it trying to compromise with the idea that I wouldn't try that path.

So, I continued _attending_ my daily job and was trying to enjoy from the backseat whenever I found spare time. I started exposing myself to all these brand new technologies out there, just scratching the surface, reading, labing, joining communities and channels. I've put up this blog in order to document all those things that I wanted to do but did not have the time to, i.e. my back-blog :smile: and in this post I will describe what I have in my mind on what the start of an automation journey could be.

# Your Baby

They say that all great journey's start with a small step, so here is the idea. A small project, a simple use case - your baby! Many would say that there are plenty of use cases that you could get inspired by from your career so far as a network engineer. I'd agree and say do not overcomplicate it. It doesn't have to be THE great idea or use case. It doesn't have to be a rocket science project. It just have to be a very basic and simple project that will open the door for you to get experience and most important to get you started.

So, what I have in mind is just a simple automation script that will `ssh` to some devices and collect information. This is the simplest basic use case I can think of and also you don't even need to have a lab for this. I would go ahead and use Cisco's sandboxes that are always on and available from anywhere. So you get two XE, one XR and one NX-OS to play around. Starting with this you can then build and expand it further and integrate it with other technologies as well and make it a full blown application that you can develop, build and deploy using automation all the way. But first, I'd give it a name just to have some substance :smile:

# Step.1 Birth

Tea or Coffee? Ansible or Python? I'd say both! Why not? Python's learning curve might frighten you at first but you must have in mind that you don't need to be fluent in it to script. And this is what you will be doing, scripting :smile: and using libraries putting together chunks of code that will fulfil your goal.
