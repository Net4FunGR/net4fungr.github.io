Imagine a beautiful sunny morning you walk into a dinner to have some brunch.
You take a seat on a free table and the waitress comes over to take your order while filling a glass of water for you.
<br><br>
-> May I have two eggs, sunny side up, and some crispy bacon, please?
<br>
=> Sure darling, anything to drink?
<br>
-> I'd like some orange juice - no ice, please.
<br>
=> Coming right up!
<br><br>
The waitress takes down your order in a peace of paper, goes over to the kitchen service area and hands in the paper to the chef.
The chef reads the order and starts shouting to his newbie cooks:
<br><br>
-> *Miguel*,
- Heat a pan with four bacon strips in it
- Take two eggs out of the fridge
- When the bacon is crisp enough, move it from the pan to a plate
- Crack the two eggs as close to the pan as you can and lower the heat
- When the eggs are ready, remove the pan from the stove and put the eggs on a plate

-> *Karla*,
- Lay some butter on both sides on two toast bread slices
- Put the toast in a heated oven for 6 minutes
- When done and the bread is crisp enough, remove them from the oven and put them on a plate
- Poor a glass of orange juice from the fridge with no ice


Eventually, after Karla and Miguel have followed the chef's instructions and prepared all the _components_, the chef can assemble them on a plate, season the eggs with salt and pepper, check if all is ok and along with the orange juice pass them to the waitress who will bring them over to your table and you will enjoy your brunch.

Well I guess by now you would have noticed the difference of what declarative versus imperative means :smile:

Your order is the **declarative** way of doing things. You just describe what you want to be done, the end result.

On the other hand, what the chef is doing, could be though of as the **imperative** way. He is giving commands, instructions on how to do individual things and tasks in order to achieve the end result.


Now, if we want to take it one step further, let's say Karla and Miguel are, by now, much more experienced and the chef does not have to explicitly tell them how to prepare every step of the recipe. In plain, they can **automate** the tasks and the chef has just to say: eggs - bacon - bread - orange juice, and that's it. It all happens faster. So, the chef is able to **orchesrtate** the automated tasks that the cooks can perform to produce the result.

Now, let's go back to the top and say that you just order the _sunny sunday morning_ from the menu, i.e. the **service catalog**, won't the whole process be faster and more clear? Yes, as long as the waitress tells the chef and he does not forget to instruct Karla not to put ice in the orange juice :smile:

Now I am getting hungry...
